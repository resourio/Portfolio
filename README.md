I wanted to create a site that had a simple,plain design that wasn't too busy. I tried to pick out colors that I find soothing and not too bright/jarring. A pet peeve of mine is visiting websites which are unnecessarily noisy and cluttered or overstimulating. I value ease of use when navigating as well and tried to make sure everything was straightforward and obvious.
